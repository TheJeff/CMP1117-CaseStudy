# CMP1117-CaseStudy
Case Study git for collaboration


## Requirements and Marking

>**Required**: Create a program that processes data with file I/O, nested loops, and other logic from the textbook.
>
>Read data from the first text file, loop through the second text file, and do something. Output something to a third text file.
>
>**Marking:** The case study will be marked out of 100 and is worth 20% of the course mark.
>
>There will be several check points, where the team members will need to submit work.

## Checkpoint 1 - Team Names
|Team Names|
|:--------:|
|Archie O  |
|Jeff N    |
|Jordan C  |
|Liam B    |

## Checkpoint 2 - Pseudocode

[Version 1](../main/pseudocode-V1.txt)

## Checkpoint 3 - Text File Details

>Details for the three text files the program will process:
>1) What information will be on the first file read in using the read() function?
>
>The glossary would be the easiest as nothing us going to be needed to analyze.
>
>2) What information will be on the second file read in, line by line?
>
>Players and their stats so they can be easily separated by the split("/t") function 
>
>3) What information will be on the output file, written out by the program?
>
>Everything + functions and outputs made in the program
>
>Only one student from each team must upload. 
>
>All student names should be at the top of the document.

## Checkpoint 4 - Code

>Writing The Code:
>This is a check point to see that your team has started coding the program.  
>One team member should submit the program code, output and text files. 
>Does the program have a menu, read the data from the 1st file and loops through the 2nd file, write to a 3rd file and have data validation?
>If you have a specific question about your code, send an email.
[Changes for Checkpoint 4](../main/Checkpoint_4_Changes.txt)

## Checkpoint 5 - Code
>Upload all Python program modules, text files, output shell showing your testing, pseudocode and indicate what each student worked on.
>Only one student from each team must upload a copy of the team project.
